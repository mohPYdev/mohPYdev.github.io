## 🏢 Experience

**Research Assistant**, University of Texas at Dallas *(Aug 2023 – Present)*  
- Led research in program analysis and security, applying ML to enhance automated vulnerability detection for C/Java systems
- Designed large-scale experimental pipelines, using fuzzing and dynamic instrumentation to benchmark 4 static analysis tools.
- Authored 4 papers (ICSE, FSE), introducing 3 novel datasets and methodologies in static analysis research.


**Backend Developer**, Eftekhar Modiran Khavarmianeh Corp. *(Feb 2023 – Jul 2023)*  
- Executed the backend system using the MVC design pattern and created the database schema for Postgres database.
- Developed Django REST API backend supporting 10k+ users with Redis caching, , cutting API response time by 40%.
- Deployed the Docker containers to Linux http servers with 99.9% uptime. 

**Research Assistant**, Model Driven Software Engineering Lab - internship *(Jan 2022 - Jan 2023)*
- Developed an automatic reservation system generator engine using MDSE approach.
- Authored a journal paper, introducing my novel approach in autoamatically generating web application. 


## 🔬 Projects

**[ArtCom – Online Art Auctions](https://github.com/mohpydev/artcom):** WebSocket-based real-time bidding with Django & React.
- Developed an online art auction and exhibition platform using React.js and Django REST Framework reducing renting costs by 90%.
- Implemented Dockerized architecture with WebSocket-based real-time auctioning supporting 200 concurrent participants.
- Designed PostgreSQL + Redis backend with user management, authentication, and data synchronization, easy deployment on Vercel.


**[LORD – Low-Code Reservation Platform](https://github.com/mohpydev/lord):** Model-driven system for generating reservation platforms.
- Pioneered a low-code reservation system generator that automated website creation, which cut deployment costs by over 90%.
- Engineered a scalable full-stack solution (Django/MySQL/React) with integrated payment processing for seamless deployment.


**[VR Physiotherapy Game](https://github.com/mohPYdev/VRPhysiotherapy):** Unity VR game with ML motion tracking.
- Developed vaious scenes and Avatars in Unity with several motions such as *transportation*, *pulling*, *pushing* and gravity logic.
- Architected a web-socket pipeline that connects *MediaPipe* model to a *node.js* server and pushed live notification to the VR application.

**Call Graph Pruning Framework:** Evaluation pipeline for reducing false positive edges of static call graphs.
- Built static call graphs (DOOP, OPAL, WALA) and instrumented Java bytecodes(ASM) to capture execution traces at runtime.
- Implemented neural networks with PyTorch and TensorFlow, automating hyperparameter tuning and fold splitting pipelines.
- Fine-tuned CodeBERT/CodeT5 models, refining attention mechanisms to improve call graph edge classification accuracy by 30%.
- Re-evaluated pruning methods, fixing dataset flaws; showed results inflated (+50% vs. actual +5%).

**Explainable AI for Static Analysis:** Evaluate and improve the application of ML in reducing false alarms of static analysis tools.
- Constructed the first explainable dataset for static analysis ML (1,132 Java samples, 67K C samples) evaluating 7 code LLMs.
- Improved model interpretability with Explanation-Guided Learning, boosting relevant line focus from 35% to 65%.
- Enhanced model classification accuracy with Input×Gradient xAI method by 20%.
